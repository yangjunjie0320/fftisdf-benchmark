WARNING!
  Very diffused basis functions are found in the basis set. They may lead to severe
  linear dependence and numerical instability.  You can set  cell.exp_to_discard=0.1
  to remove the diffused Gaussians whose exponents are less than 0.1.


WARN: ke_cutoff/mesh (20 / [17 17 17]) is not enough for FFTDF to get integral accuracy 1e-08.
Coulomb integral error is ~ 1e+02 Eh.
Recommended ke_cutoff/mesh are 1166.24 / [123 123 123].
